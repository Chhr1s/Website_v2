      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Intro During my MS, I worked on a few manuscripts which used growth modeling. These topics are well supported, but sometimes the support is hard to find if you don’t know where to look. After subscribing to the lavaan support Google Group, I saw many people requesting growth model and/or parallel process model support. I responded back to people a few times, but I figured it was just better to put a perminant link up showing the steps that can be used to fit, compare, and interpret growth models in lavaan (one of my favorite statistical packages/software I’ve ever used!</description>

      <description>Intro Tidyverse’s newest release has recently come together to form a cohesive suite of packages for modeling and machine learning, called {tidymodels}. The successor to Max Kuhn’s {caret} package, {tidymodels} allows for a tidy approach to your data from start to finish. We’re going to walk through the basics for getting off the ground with {tidymodels} and demonstrate its application to three different tree-based methods for predicting student test scores.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
