      <description>Introduction: The first research project I worked on in graduate school was a secondary data analysis on a longitudinal study. I developed some research questions and dove in. I looked for wave-to-wave changes in various constructs of interest to me. Quickly, though, I began asking questions about the growth and change of dynamic factors that I couldn’t answer with the methods I knew. One P.I. directed me towards structural equation modeling—as this was her background—with focus on growth models.</description>

      <description>Intro Tidyverse’s newest release has recently come together to form a cohesive suite of packages for modeling and machine learning, called {tidymodels}. The successor to Max Kuhn’s {caret} package, {tidymodels} allows for a tidy approach to your data from start to finish. We’re going to walk through the basics for getting off the ground with {tidymodels} and demonstrate its application to three different tree-based methods for predicting student test scores.</description>
